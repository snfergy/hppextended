ITAFNAME1;Opening of the Litoranea Balbo;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ITAFDESC1;In March 1937, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini made a state visit to Italian Libya to open this new military and civilian highway, built by governor-general Italo Balbo. When Balbo died in 1940 in a plane crash, the Italian government named the 1822 kilometer road in his honour.\nThe Italians also constructed a minor road parallel starting from Marj through Marawa, to Lamluda, with a length of 143 km (89 mi)\n\nNear the middle of the road, the border of Italian Tripolitania and Italian Cyrenaica was marked by a Marble Arch, named Arch of Fileni. It was created by the Italian architect Florestano Di Fausto.\n Upon it lay an inscription which read: Alme Sol, possis nihil urbe Roma visere maius (Latin for "Oh kind Sun, may you never look upon a city greater than Rome"). The "Arch of Fileni" was demolished in 1970 by the new coup d'état revolutionary regime of Muammar Gaddafi.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

ITAFNAME2;Settlement of Italian Colonists;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ITAFDESC2;In early 1937 Mussolini sought to fully colonize Libya, introducing 30,000 Italian colonists which brought their numbers to more than 100,000 within the territory. These colonists were shipped primarily to Sahel al-Jefara in Tripolitania and the Jebel Akhdar in Cyrenaica, and given land from which the indigenous inhabitants had been partially removed during the colonial war in the 1920s.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

ITAFNAME3;Work on Via della Vittoria begins;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ITAFDESC3;The "Via della Vittoria" (Victory Road), was built by Italian engineers during World War II, between June and December 1940. The road went from Sidi Barrani, Egypt, to the border of Italian Libya and connected to the Via Balbia. It was 11 metres (12 yd) wide and asphalted.\nThe need of communication in order to supply the Army forced the construction of this new road.\n\nItalian engineers are now in the process of begining construction of this road.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

ITAFNAME5;Libyan volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ITAFDESC5;In 1939, laws were passed that allowed Muslims to be permitted to join the National Fascist Party and in particular the Muslim Association of the Lictor (Associazione Musulmana del Littorio), and the 1939 reforms allowed the creation of Libyan military units within the Italian army.\n\nAs a consequence during the Second World War, there was strong support for Italy between many Libyans, who enrolled in the Italian Army (other Libyan troops were fighting for the Kingdom of Italy since the 1920s: the Savari (cavalry regiments) and the mounted police called Spahi).\nIndeed, two divisions of Libyan colonial troops (with 30000 native Muslim soldiers) were created (and in summer 1940 the first and second Divisions of Fanteria Libica -Libyan infantry - participated in the Italian offensive against British army in Egypt) 1 Libyan Division Sibelle and 2 Libyan Division Pescatori.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

ITADESC8;The Munich Agreement was a settlement permitting Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation, the "Sudetenland", was coined.\nThe agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September) after being negotiated at a conference held in Munich, Germany, among the major powers of Europe, excluding the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
ITAFOPTA8;We do not oppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
