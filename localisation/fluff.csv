SPRFDESC1;The Santoña Agreement or Pact of Santoña was an agreement signed in the town of Guriezo, near Santoña, Cantabria, on August 24, 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, between politicians close to the Basque Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista Vasco or PNV), fighting with the Republican Side, and Italian forces fighting with the Francoist side.\n\nAfter the fall of Bilbao, practically all Basque territory had fallen into Franco's hands. Juan de Ajuriaguerra, then president of the Biscay Regional Council of the Basque Nationalist Party, negotiated with the Italian army command a surrender agreement. The PNV offered to surrender the Basque army in exchange of its prisoners being treated as POWs under Italian command, and PNV members being allowed to go to exile in several British ships.\n\nThe surrender was brokered on condition that the Basque heavy industry and economy was left untouched. The agreement was carried out by the PNV behind the Republican government's back. For this reason, it is also known as the Santoña Treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
