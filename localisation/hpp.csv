the_lend_lease_stop_desc;The Lend-Lease Agreements were arrangements for the transfer of war supplies, including food, machinery, and services, to nations whose defence was considered vital to the defence of the United States in World War II. The Lend-Lease Act, passed in 1941 by the U.S. Congress, gave the President power to sell, transfer, lend, or lease such war materials. The President was directed to set the terms for aid repayment to be ‘in kind or property, or any other direct or indirect benefit which the President deems satisfactory.’ Harry L. Hopkins was appointed  in Mar., 1941 to administer lend-lease. He was replaced in July of the same year by Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., who headed the Office of Lend-Lease Administration, set up in Oct., 1941. In Sept.,1943, lend-lease was incorporated into the Foreign Economic Administration under Leo T. Crowley. In Sept., 1945, it was transferred to the Dept. of State. Lend-lease was originally intended for China and countries of the British Empire. In Nov., 1941, the USSR was included, and by the end of the war practically all the allies of the United States had been declared eligible for lend-lease aid. Although not all requested or received it, lend-lease agreements were signed with numerous countries.;Les accords sur le prêt-bail concernent la livraison d'armements, de vivres, de machines-outils et de services aux nations dont la défense est considérée comme vitale pour la protection des intérêts des États-Unis d'Amérique pendant la seconde guerre mondiale. Le 'Lend-Lease Act' (loi sur le prêt-bail), adopté en 1941 par le Congrès américain, donne autorité au Président pour la vente, le transfert, le prêt ou la location financière de ravitaillements de guerre. Le Président a également tout pouvoir pour fixer les conditions des paiements de cette aide qui peut consister en 'toute sorte de biens, ou tout autre avantage direct ou indirect jugé satisfaisant par le Président'. Harry L. Hopkins est nommé en mars 1941 pour gérer le prêt-bail. Il est remplacé en juillet par Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., qui prend la direction du Bureau du Prêt-bail, organisme créé en octobre 1941. En septembre 1943 le prêt-bail est incorporé au Ministère des relations économiques internationales sous la direction de Leo T. Crowley. En septembre 1945 enfin, il passe sous la tutelle du Ministère des Affaires étrangères. Le prêt-bail est à l'origine destiné à venir en aide à la Chine et aux pays de l'Empire Britannique. En novembre 1941, l'Union Soviétique est ajoutée à la liste des pays bénéficiaires et, à la fin de la guerre, quasiment tous les alliés des États-Unis ont le droit de bénéficier de cette loi. Un très grand nombre d'alliés ont finalement bénéficié d'accords de prêt-bail, même si certains ne les ont pas réclamés ou ne les ont pas reçus.;Die Leih- und Pachtabkommen waren Vereinbarungen, Nationen, deren Verteidigung für die USA während des Zweiten Weltkriegs von höchster Bedeutung war, mit kriegswichtigem Nachschub zu versorgen, einschließlich Nahrung, Ausrüstung und Dienstleistungen. Das Leih- und Pachtgesetz wurde 1941 vom US-Kongress verabschiedet und gab dem Präsident die Erlaubnis, derartige Kriegsmaterialien zu verkaufen, transferieren, auszuleihen oder zu vermieten. Der Präsident wurde dazu angehalten, die Rückzahlungen für die amerikanische Hilfe auf Sachleistungen, Liegenschaften oder jede andere direkte oder indirekte Vergütung festzulegen, die ihm als zufrieden stellend erschienen. Harry L. Hopkins wurde im März 1941 mit der Organisation des Leih- und Pachtgeschäfts betraut. Im Juli desselben Jahres wurde er durch Edward R. Stettinius Jr. ersetzt, der schließlich auch der im Oktober 1941 eingerichteten Leih- und Pachtadministration vorstand. Im September 1943 wurde das Leih- und Pachtgeschäft in die Foreign Economic Administration unter Leo T. Crowley integriert, zwei Jahre später schließlich zum State Department transferiert. Das Leih- und Pachtgesetz war ursprünglich für China, Großbritannien und andere Commonwealthstaaten vorgesehen. Im November 1941 wurde die USSR in das Programm aufgenommen, und bei Kriegsende empfingen praktisch sämtliche Alliierten der USA Unterstützung im Rahmen des Leih- und Pachtgesetzes, doch nicht alle der zahlreichen Länder, die dementsprechende Abkommen unterzeichnet hatten, benötigten diese Hilfe auch oder erhielten sie tatsächlich.;;Fue una serie de acuerdos para la transferencia de suministros de guerra, a países cuya defensa se consideraba vital para el bienestar de los EEUU durante la II Guerra Mundial. Aprobada en 1941 por el Congreso de los EEUU, dio poderes al presidente para vender, transferir, prestar o arrendar material bélico. Se encargó al presidente que fijara los términos del pago de la ayuda 'en especie o bienes, o cualquier otro beneficio directo o indirecto que el presidente considere satisfactorio'. En marzo de 1941, Harry L. Hopkins fue nombrado administrador de préstamos y arriendos. En julio fue sustituido por Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., que pasó a encabezar la Oficina de Administración de Préstamos y Arriendos, fundada en octubre de 1941. En septiembre de 1943, fueron incorporados a la Administración Económica de Exterior, al mando de Leo T. Crowley. En septiembre de 15 fue transferido al Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores. En un principio, fueron pensados para China y los países del Imperio Británico.

On January 4th, the 9000-strong troops started to move from Yunling Township of Jing County towards Jiangsu, planning to cross the river via three routes. On January 5th, the Communist forces were surrounded in Maolin Township by a Nationalist force of 80,000 led by Shangguan Yunxiang and attacked days later. After days of fighting, heavy losses — including many civilian workers who staffed the army's political headquarters — were inflicted on the New Fourth Army due to the overwhelming numbers of Nationalist troops. On January 13th, Ye Ting, wanting to save his men, went to Shangguan Yunxiang's headquarters to negotiate terms. Upon arrival, Ye was detained. The New Fourth Army's political commissar Xiang Ying was killed, and only 2,000 people, led by Huang Huoxing and Fu Qiutao, were able to break out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

ultimatum_to_lithuania_desc;Lithuania's constitution asserted that Vilnius was still the capital of the country even though Vilnius lay in Poland. This caused tensions which prompted tense border incidents. Things boiled over when a Lithuanian border guard shot a Polish officer at the border. Poland's public was outraged and Poland sent an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding that the constitution be amended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_ngoc_title;Form the Jingwei Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
create_ngoc_desc;March 1940 a puppet government led by Wang Jingwei was established in the Republic of China under the protection of Empire of Japan, officially styling itself the Reorganized National Government of China.  Wang Jingwei was originally the leader of the left-leaning anti Chiang Kai-shek faction of the Kuomintang.  He followed the KMT leadership during the relocation of the capital to Chongqing, and once there organized the fascist-leaning KMT members into his faction.  During this time Wang became convinced that China would lose the war, and on Jan. 1, 1939 Wang was expelled from the KMT.  In March '39 he survived an assassination attempt in Hanoi.  Jingwei and his clique then fled to Shanghai, where negotiations took place with Japan for the fate of China after the war.  Wang saw this as his long-sought opportunity to create a government free of Chiang's control, and became the president of the Republic of China - Nanjing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reoccupation_of_the_rhineland_hpp_desc;Once the home front was secured, Hitler turned his attention to foreign policy with four increasingly daring acts. On the 16th of March 1935, the treaty of Versailles was violated by Germany as military conscription was reintroduced (the treaty stated that the German Army should not exceed 100,000 men). When nothing more than official protests from England and France ensued, Hitler sought to renegotiate the Treaty of Versailles with England and reoccupy the Rhineland, bypassing France and improving relations with England at the expense of some internal unrest in Germany.;Une fois les conflits internes réglés en sa faveur, Hitler se tourne vers la politique étrangère, ne reculant devant aucune audace. Le 16 mars 1935, l'Allemagne viole ouvertement le traité de Versailles en réintroduisant la conscription militaire (le traité limitait la taille de l'armée allemande à 100 000 hommes). Le manque de réaction de la France et de l'Angleterre qui s'en tiennent à des protestations diplomatiques mène Hitler à aller encore plus loin en réoccupant un an plus tard, le 7 mars 1936, la Rhénanie démilitarisée, violant ainsi à nouveau le Traité de Versailles.;Nachdem die Heimatfront gesichert war, wandte sich Hitler mit vier zunehmend wagemutigen Handlungen der Außenpolitik zu: Am 16. März 1935 verletzte Deutschland durch die Wiedereinführung der Wehrpflicht die Statuten des Versailler Vertrags (der die Größe der deutschen Armee auf maximal 100.000 Mann festgelegte). Als außer offiziellen Protesten aus England und Frankreich Konsequenzen darauf ausblieben, ging Hitler am 7. März 1936 mit der Wiederbesetzung des demilitarisierten Rheinlands noch einen Schritt weiter und verletzte den Versailler Vertrag ein weiteres Mal.;;Una vez asegurado el frente interno, Hitler volvió su atención a la política exterior con cuatro acciones, cada una más osada que la anterior. El 7 de marzo de 1935, Alemania violó el Tratado de Versalles al reintroducir el servicio militar obligatorio (según los términos del tratado, el ejército alemán no podía exceder los 100.000 hombres). Cuando la única consecuencia fue las protestas oficiales de Inglaterra y Francia, un año después (el 7 de marzo de 1936), Hitler procedió a ocupar la desmilitarizada Renania, violando de nuevo el Tratado de Versalles.;;;;;;;;;x

scw_informations_title;The Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
scw_informations_desc;There are a few things about the Spanish Civil War and how it works in the mod that you should be aware of.\n\n1. Almost the entire Army, Navy and Air Force goes to the Nationalist side. There's no practical way of distributing the forces both historically and realistically at the same time.\n2. The Republican side will gain Militia forces via decision within a few days of the conflict's start. They are scripted to be about the same size as the original Army with a slight advantage in numbers. But being level 0 Militia, they are a lot weaker one on one.\n3. Both sides will get some scripted forces to help out. The Nationalists will also get some convoys.\n4. In case of a Republican victory, THE ENTIRE MILITARY THEY HAVE WILL BE REMOVED! That includes the construction queue as well! This is required to remove the scripted Militia from the start of the war. You will, however, get back the entire military of the Nationalists, or rather what's left of it. So you should keep production to a minimum and try to route the enemy forces instead of destroying them.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

36_olympics_text;The 1936 Summer Olympics took place in Berlin, Germany, from 1 to 16 August.\n\nBy removing signs stating "Jews not wanted" and similar slogans from the city's main tourist attractions, the Nazi party tried to downplay its radical ideology before the eyes of the world. At the same time, only members of the Aryan race were allowed to compete for Germany. The four gold medals won by the black American athlete Jesse Owens were a private embarrassment for Hitler although the Berlin crowds enthusiastically cheered Owens' victories.\n\nThe Berlin Olympics were attended by 49 nations in spite of calls for a boycott because of Nazi antisemitism. The only country to institute a boycott was Spain. The internationally isolated Soviet Union did not participate either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

india_independence_text;The term Indian independence movement encompasses a wide spectrum of political organizations and movements which had the common aim of ending British colonial authority in parts of South Asia. The term incorporates various national and regional campaigns, agitations and efforts of both nonviolent and militant philosophy. The first organized militant movements were in Bengal, but it later took political stage in the form of a mainstream movement in the then newly formed Indian National Congress, with prominent moderate leaders seeking only their basic rights to appear for civil services examinations and more rights, economic in nature, for the people of the soil. The beginning of the early 1900s saw a more radical approach towards political independence proposed by leaders such as the Lal Bal Pal and Sri Aurobindo. Militant nationalism also emerged in the first decades, culminating in the failed Indo-German Pact and Ghadar Conspiracy during the Great War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
2_2_6_incident_info;The February 26 incident was an attempted coup d'état in Japan, from February 26 to 29, 1936 carried out by 1,483 troops of the Imperial Japanese Army. Several leading politicians were killed and the center of Tokyo was briefly occupied by the rebelling troops. At that time, the incident was called the deplorable incident in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
august4coup_info;In May of 1936 widespread agrarian unrest and industrial unrest in the north of Greece erupted, which eventually brought the head of the government, General Metaxas, to suspend the parliament on the eve of a major strike, on August 4, 1936. Endorsed by the king, Metaxas declared a state of emergency, decreed martial law, annulled various articles of the Constitution and established a crisis cabinet to put to an end the growing riots and to restore social order. In one of his first speeches, Metaxas announced: "I have decided to hold all the power I need for saving Greece from the catastrophes which threaten her".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
uk_asks_for_transit_rights_desc;The United Kingdom asks for transit rights through our country.

nanjing_massacre_title;The Nanking Massacre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nanjing_massacre_desc;In the autumn of 1937, Japanese war planes began bombing Nanjing, concentrating their efforts on the downtown areas, which were most densely populated by civilians. As Nanjing came under attack, the capital was again moved, this time to Chongqing. Knowing that Japanese troops were en route toward the city, the people panicked and tried to flee. On 9th Dec 1937, Japanese ground forces reached Nanjing, where they were met with minimal resistence from overwhelmed and fatigued Chinese military units. By 13th Dec, with Japanese troops attacking the city from all angles, the Chinese forces were routed. Fearing the consequences of surrender to the Japanese, Chinese military men donned civilian clothing and retreated into the city. It was on this day that the six-week stretch of atrocities against the civilian population of Nanjing began. The news of the massacre soon hit the world and significantly deteriorated Japan’s relations with the Democratic countries of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hu_hanmin_dies_desc;Hu Hanmin was one of the early leaders of Kuomintang. Shortly after the 1911 revolution, he was appointed governor of Guangdong. After Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, he was one of the three most powerful figures in KMT. He became a powerful leader of South China, and opposed Chiang Kai-Shek. He died of cerebral hemorrhage on May 12, 1936.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

blomberg_affair_desc;In early 1938, the long-brewing conflict between the National Socialist Party and the old guard in the German Army reached a boiling point. Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, in particular, had long wanted to curb the influence of the generals in order to get more power for themselves. Now, they suddenly found themselves with a good pretext to do so: the widowed Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg had recently remarried and it was discovered that his young bride, unbeknownst to him, had once been a prostitute and a model for pornographic photos. This violated the standard of conduct for officers as defined by Blomberg himself and was a shock to Hitler - Göring had been Blomberg's best man and Hitler himself a witness at the wedding. Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage in order to avoid a scandal. But Blomberg refused, saying that he loved his wife and that he was willing to forgive her for her chequered past. The Führer was faced with the choice between forcing his valuable minister to resign or keeping him in office despite the uproar it would cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fritsch_affair_desc;The events surrounding Blomberg's marriage inspired Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler to arrange a similar affair for the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch. Göring, in his capacity as head of the Luftwaffe, considered Fritsch to be one of his main rivals. He was angered by the Colonel-General trying to limit the size and role of the air force. Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht and its mainly aristocratic leaders in order to strengthen his Schutzstaffel and especially the Waffen-SS as a competitor to the regular German Army. Not long after Blomberg's resignation, Fritsch was accused of being a homosexual by Himmler and the SS. They produced a police file and a bribed witness to corroborate the charges. Hitler knew full well that there was no truth in them, but he had long suspected Fritsch of harbouring anti-Nazi sentiments and saw a good opportunity to get rid of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hess_to_scotland_desc;Like Goebbels, Hess was privately distressed by the war with the United Kingdom because he, like almost all other Nazis, hoped that Britain would accept Germany as an ally. Hess may have hoped to score a diplomatic victory by sealing a peace between the Third Reich and Britain, e.g., by implementing the behind-the-scenes move of the Haushofers in Nazi Germany to contact Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
polgovtchange_desc;Zyndram-Koscialkowski's government included people from all parts of the Sanacja and was mostly focused on improving Poland's economy, with the Minister of Treasury Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski playing a pivotal role and Zyndram-Koscialkowski playing the part of a man of the people. In May 1936 however the president decided it was a time to reconstruct the government, to counter the threat of further divisions between the left and right wings of the Sanacja. The new government would however include most of Zyndram's men, including former prime minister himself, this time as minister of security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

20_july_plot_desc;The 20 July plot of 1944 was an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia. The plot was the culmination of the efforts of the German resistence to overthrow the Nazi regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
operation_valkyrie_desc;The assassination attempt on Hitler's life was followed up by a military coup d'état, led by former Chief of Staff Ludwig Beck, Carl Goerdeler and Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. With Hitler out of the picture, a new government is about to be formed with Beck as Head of State and Goerdeler as Chancellor. There's still the question of what we should do with the old regime, and with the War in the West!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infantry_doctrine_desc;Infantry Doctrine determines the tactics used by our Infantry. Proponents of Firepower focus suggest that by increasing the amount of heavy weaponry in our Infantry units, we can focus more firepower on the enemy. The Shock Focus doctrine says that the enemy should be overwhelmed by powerfull, direct assaults by our men. Infiltration and Maneuver on the other hand suggests that the soldiers should use their enviroment to their advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tank_doctrine_desc;Tank Doctrine determines the role of armoured units in our army. The old school of generals say that the role of the tank should be supporting the Infantry. The proponents of the Armoured Schwerpunkt say that tanks should be used for achieving breakthroughs in the enemy line by concentrating our armour on a single point on the front. The third possibility is to use machine and man to supplement eachother, but that would require the use of mobile infantry units, capable of keeping up with the armoured formations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
operational_doctrine_desc;Operational Doctrine determines how our Army functions as a whole, and can be divided into four branches. Grand Battle Plan favours the slow, methodical approach with heavy artillery barrages. Superior Firepower focuses on the use of large support detachments, but require them to be motorized in order to be applicable. Blitzkrieg tries to achieve quick breakthrough, cutting the enemy's communication and supply lines. Human Wave means overwhelming the enemy with wave after wave of soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Blitzkrieg tries to achieve quick breakthrough, cutting the enemy's communication and supply lines. Human Wave means overwhelming the enemy with wave after wave of soldiers. Meachanized Wave is similar to Human Wave, but instead of Infantry, it operates with tanks, motorized and mechanized units.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
great_depression_desc;The Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash of October, 1929 and rapidly spread worldwide. The market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth and personal advancement. The economy reached bottom in the winter of 1932-33, then came four years of very rapid growth until 1937, when the Recession of 1937 brought back 1934 levels of unemployment. The depression caused major political changes in America. Three years into the depression, Herbert Hoover lost the 1932 presidential election to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a sweeping landslide. Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the New Deal, instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of American politics.\n\n[NOTE: In the game this is represented by a modifier seriously hurting your economy. The effects of the Great Depression will slowly fade away as the game progresses and the fading can be sped up by keeping up with the New Deal or increasing your Economic Laws. You can check the current effect by hovering your mouse over your country's flag.];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
great_depression_fading_desc;The Great Depression, while still not completely over, is slowly fading away. Unemployment is going down, stock prices are going up, people start to believe in the economy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
after_the_depression_desc;The Great Depression is finally over, and things are back to normal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
molotov_line_event_name;Build the Molotov Line;;;;;;;;;;;;x
molotov_line_event_desc;Stalin has decided to build the Molotov Line.  The defenses can either be built from scratch, or the Stalin Line can be dismantled and used to accelerate construction of the Molotov Line.\n\n(Note that either option will add the forts to the build queue, and moving the Stalin Line will shorten construction times but will reduce the level of the existing fortifications!  Also, game engine limitations prevent serial builds from being loaded, so only 1 round of forts will appear in the build queue);;;;;;;;;;;;x
hebei_demil_event_desc;The terms of the Tanggu Truce of 1933 forbid China from stationing troops other than border guards in the northern province of Hebei.  To model this in-game, the area near Beijing will be cut off from land through the use of a low infrastructure "wall", but can still be supplied through Tianjin's port.  This "wall" will go away when China is at war with Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1225;The Czechoslovak government built a system of border fortifications, as well as some fortified defensive lines inland, from 1935 to 1938 as a defensive countermeasure against the rising threat of Nazi Germany. The objective of the fortifications was to prevent the taking of key areas by an enemy (not only Germany but also Hungary) by means of a sudden attack before the mobilization of the Czechoslovak army could be completed, and to enable effective defence until allies (Britain and France and possibly the Soviet Union) could help.\n\nThis event adds land forts to the production queue at a reduced cost to strengthen the central border fortifications between Trutnov and Ostrava in the north and Znojmo and Komárno in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1226;This event adds land forts to the production queue at a reduced cost to extend the German-facing border fortifications east from Ostrava to Ceský Tesín and west from Trutnov along the length of your northern frontier to Karlovy Vary and then south as far as Prachatice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1227;This event adds land forts to the production queue at a reduced cost to extend the southern border fortifications from Prachatice all the way east to Kosice.  It will also extend the line north from Ceské Budejovice to Praha to cover the capital's western approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
polish_treaty_of_munich_desc;During the summer of 1938 the pro-Nazi elements among the Czech Germans demanded the right to secede from Czechoslovakia, a move that created enormous tension between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler, using the minority sentiments in the Sudetenland, started to propagandize about ‘Czech Atrocities’ against ethnic Germans in an effort to lay the blame of a future conflict on the Czech government. At the same time as German troops infiltrated the Bohemian borderlands Hitler agreed to host a Peace Conference in Munich. Hitler, Chamberlain, Daladier, and Mussolini met and agreed that Hitler should have the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. The Czechs, who were not represented at the meeting, realised that their own allies were deserting them and under the pressure from the French and British they were forced to surrender the Sudetenland to Germany. Hitler assured those at the meeting that this was the extent of his ambitions for expansion. Chamberlain returned to England with a piece of paper signed by Hitler, proclaiming 'peace in our time'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
polish_czechoslovakia_reaction_desc;The Polish–Romanian Alliance was a series of treaties signed in the interwar period by the Second Polish Republic and the Kingdom of Romania. The first of them was signed in 1921 and, together, the treaties formed a basis for good foreign relations between the two countries that lasted until World War II began in 1939.\n\nIn the face of increasing German beligerence several figures within the government have suggested to continue and strengthen the pact between our two countries for mutual defence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
polish_romanian_call_to_arms_desc;Historically after the German invasion of Poland on September 1, Poland declined Romanian military assistance, but it expected to receive assistance instead from its British and French allies through Romanian ports; thus the reason for the Romanian Bridgehead plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
polish_romanian_call_to_arms_accepted_desc;The Romanians have joined the war on the side of the Poles!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
german_partition_of_romania_desc;Now that we've dealt with the Romanians and Poles we should decide how to partition Romania itself./n/nHaving signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact the Soviets have expressed their demands for Bessarabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soviet_munich_treaty_name;Czechoslovak-Soviet Treaty of Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soviet_munich_treaty_desc;May 16, 1935 marked the day the Czechoslovak-Soviet Treaty of Alliance was signed between the two states as the consequence of the Soviet alliance with France (which was the Czechoslovak main ally)./n/nAt the insistence of the Czechoslovak government, a protocol on the signing of the treaty stipulated that the treaty would go into force only if France gave assistance to the victim of aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
