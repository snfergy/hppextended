Juan de Ajuriaguerra, then president of the Biscay Regional Council of the Basque Nationalist Party, negotiated with the Italian army command a surrender agreement. The PNV offered to surrender the Basque army in exchange of its prisoners being treated as POWs under Italian command, and PNV members being allowed to go to exile in several British ships.\n\nThe surrender was brokered on condition that the Basque heavy industry and economy was left untouched. The agreement was carried out by the PNV behind the Republican government's back. For this reason, it is also known as the Santoña Treason.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
